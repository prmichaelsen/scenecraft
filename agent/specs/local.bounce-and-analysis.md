**Namespace**: local
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2026-04-27
**Last Updated**: 2026-04-27
**Status**: Retroactive (codifies existing behavior)

## Purpose

Codify the end-to-end contract of the offline bounce + mix-analysis pipeline:
the frontend renders PCM via `OfflineAudioContext` cloning the live mix graph,
encodes WAV (16 / 24 / 32-float bit depth), POSTs to the engine; the engine
stores the WAV content-addressed under `pool/mixes/` (analysis) or
`pool/bounces/` (bounce), then for analysis runs librosa + pyloudnorm and
caches the result. The **bit-identical offline = live** invariant is load-
bearing: the backend never reimplements the mixer.

## Source

- Retroactive black-box spec (`--from-draft`, interactive) derived from:
  - `scenecraft/src/lib/mix-render.ts` (frontend render + WAV encoder)
  - `scenecraft/src/lib/chat-client.ts` (`handleMixRenderRequest`, `handleBounceAudioRequest`, `filterTracksForBounce`)
  - `scenecraft-engine/src/scenecraft/chat.py` (`_exec_analyze_master_bus`, `_exec_bounce_audio`, `_MIX_RENDER_EVENTS`, `_BOUNCE_RENDER_EVENTS`)
  - `scenecraft-engine/src/scenecraft/api_server.py` (`/mix-render-upload`, `/bounce-upload`)
- Audit report: `agent/reports/audit-2-architectural-deep-dive.md` §1E unit 3; §2 invariant `Audio = Frontend`.

## Scope

**In-scope**:
- `renderMixToBuffer(tracks, opts)` — bit-identical offline render via `OfflineAudioContext` reusing `mix-graph.ts`.
- `encodePCMToWav(pcm, sr, channels, bitDepth)` at 16 / 24 / 32-bit.
- WS round-trip: `mix_render_request` / `bounce_audio_request` → PCM → WAV → HTTP multipart POST.
- `/mix-render-upload` + `/bounce-upload` upload validation (hash, sample_rate, channels, duration drift ≤ 100ms).
- Content-addressed WAV persistence at `pool/mixes/<mix_graph_hash>.wav` and `pool/bounces/<composite_hash>.wav`.
- `_exec_analyze_master_bus` cache lookup + librosa/pyloudnorm analyses (peak, true_peak, RMS, LUFS, clipping_detect, spectral_centroid, dynamic_range).
- `_exec_bounce_audio` selection filter (`full` / `tracks` / `clips`), bit-depth + sample-rate validation, cache by `composite_hash`.
- Live-playback pause/resume around offline render.
- The **"backend MUST NOT reimplement the mixer"** invariant.

**Out-of-scope** (covered elsewhere):
- Construction of the live mix graph (crossfade math, effect chain topology, clip scheduling) — see `local.webaudio-mixer-and-mix-graph`.
- Per-effect DSP math — see `local.audio-effects-and-curve-scheduling`.
- `mix_graph_hash` / `composite_hash` field composition — see hash-specific specs.
- Chat-tool destructive-op elicitation (analyze / bounce are both non-destructive).

## Requirements

1. **R1 — Bit-identical offline render.** `renderMixToBuffer` wires the exact same topology as the live mixer (`source → clipGain → crossfadeGain → trackGain → masterGain → masterFxChain → destination`) via the shared `mix-graph.ts` helpers. For a given `(tracks, startTimeS, endTimeS, sampleRate, channels, masterEffects)`, the returned PCM is byte-identical to the rendered output of the live mixer for the same window.
2. **R2 — Window semantics.** `renderMixToBuffer({startTimeS, endTimeS})` includes every clip whose `[start_time, end_time)` intersects the window; clips entirely outside are omitted. Requires `endTimeS > startTimeS` or throws. The offline clock `t = 0` corresponds to timeline `t = startTimeS`.
3. **R3 — Channel + sample-rate contract.** `channels ∈ {1, 2}` (default 2); `sampleRate` defaults to 48000 and must be > 0. Any other channel count throws. Output `pcm` is interleaved L/R for stereo, mono verbatim for mono.
4. **R4 — WAV bit depth.** `encodePCMToWav` supports `bitDepth ∈ {16, 24, 32}`. 16/24 are signed PCM `wFormatTag=0x0001`; 32 is IEEE-754 float `wFormatTag=0x0003`. Default 16. Values outside this set throw. Output conforms to the canonical 44-byte RIFF/WAVE header documented in `mix-render.ts`.
5. **R5 — Clip decode resilience.** `resolveClipBuffer` consults the shared buffer cache (keyed by `clip.source_path`); on fetch / decode failure it logs and returns `null`, and the caller drops that clip from the schedule rather than failing the whole render.
6. **R6 — Live-playback pause/resume.** Both `handleMixRenderRequest` and `handleBounceAudioRequest` pause the live mixer before rendering iff `isPlaying` is true and a `mixer` is supplied; they resume (only if previously playing) in a `finally` block that runs on success and on failure. If no mixer / not playing, neither pause nor resume is attempted.
7. **R7 — Upload contract (mix-render).** Client POSTs multipart to `/api/projects/:name/mix-render-upload` with fields `audio` (WAV blob), `mix_graph_hash` (64-char hex), `start_time_s`, `end_time_s`, `sample_rate`, `channels`, `request_id`. Server validates: hex length; numeric parsability; `channels ∈ {1,2}`; `sample_rate > 0`; `end_time_s > start_time_s`; WAV header `channels` and `sampleRate` match form fields; WAV `duration = frames/sr` is within 100ms of `end - start`. On any failure after bytes hit disk, the file is unlinked. Response 200 echoes `rendered_path`.
8. **R8 — Upload contract (bounce).** Same shape, posted to `/api/projects/:name/bounce-upload`, substituting `composite_hash` for `mix_graph_hash` and adding `bit_depth ∈ {16,24,32}`.
9. **R9 — Content-addressed persistence.** WAV lands at `pool/mixes/<mix_graph_hash>.wav` (analysis) or `pool/bounces/<composite_hash>.wav` (bounce). Re-upload with the same hash overwrites the same bytes (safe: same graph ⇒ same bytes).
10. **R10 — WS round-trip + event signalling.** Chat tool creates an `asyncio.Event`, registers it in `_MIX_RENDER_EVENTS` / `_BOUNCE_RENDER_EVENTS` keyed by `request_id` (uuid4 hex), emits the WS request, then `await event.wait()` with a timeout (default 60s; monkeypatchable via `MIX_RENDER_TIMEOUT_S` / `BOUNCE_RENDER_TIMEOUT_S`). The upload handler calls `set_mix_render_event(request_id)` / `set_bounce_render_event(request_id)` on success. On timeout the tool returns `{"error": "... timeout ...", ...}`.
11. **R11 — Cache (analysis).** `_exec_analyze_master_bus` keys its cache by `(mix_graph_hash, start_time_s, end_time_s, sample_rate, analyzer_version)`. A cache hit returns `cached: true` and the persisted scalars / clipping-event count **without** re-decoding the WAV or re-running librosa. `force_rerun: true` deletes the prior row and re-analyzes.
12. **R12 — Cache (bounce).** `_exec_bounce_audio` keys by `composite_hash` (which already encodes mode/selection/window/format). A hit with `rendered_path != null` returns `cached: true` + download URL. A row with `rendered_path = null` (prior timeout) is deleted before retry.
13. **R13 — Analyses & scalars.** Known analyses are `peak`, `true_peak`, `rms`, `lufs`, `clipping_detect`, `spectral_centroid`, `dynamic_range`. Unknown names are silently skipped. Silence / too-short buffers map to `-inf` (peak/lufs) and `dynamic_range` is skipped (not persisted) when either input is `-inf`. Clipping threshold is `|y| ≥ 0.99`; runs separated by < 10ms are merged.
14. **R14 — Bounce validation.** `sample_rate ∈ {44100, 48000, 88200, 96000}`; `bit_depth ∈ {16, 24, 32}`; `channels ∈ {1, 2}`; `start_time_s ≥ 0`; `end_time_s > start_time_s` (if `end_time_s` null → resolved as `MAX(audio_clips.end_time)` with `deleted_at IS NULL`); `track_ids` and `clip_ids` are mutually exclusive; existence of referenced `track_ids` / `clip_ids` is verified before rendering. Any violation → `{"error": ...}`.
15. **R15 — Selection filter.** `filterTracksForBounce`:
    - `full` → unchanged tracks;
    - `tracks` → tracks whose id is in `track_ids`;
    - `clips` → clips whose id is in `clip_ids`; tracks with zero matching clips are dropped.
    Mixer mute/solo semantics still apply inside each track.
16. **R16 — Sample-rate agreement.** On analyze, if the WAV's header sample_rate ≠ the requested `sample_rate` (cache key), return `{"error": ...}` — the cache row is never written.
17. **R17 — Frontend-as-source-of-truth invariant.** The backend MUST NOT contain any code that synthesizes or mixes PCM. Its only audio-production role is (a) storing bytes uploaded by the frontend at a content-addressed path, and (b) reading those bytes back for analysis. Any future feature that needs rendered PCM goes through the same WS round-trip.
18. **R18 — Fire-and-forget handler.** The frontend WS handlers swallow all render/encode/upload errors (logged to `console.warn`); the backend times out on its own. The frontend never retries.
19. **R19 — Pending-row cleanup on failure.** On WS send failure, upload timeout, WAV-still-missing race, or stat/wave-open failure, `_exec_bounce_audio` deletes the pending `audio_bounces` row before returning the error.

---

## Behavior (step-by-step)

### Analyze round-trip (cache miss, ws present)

1. Chat tool `_exec_analyze_master_bus` validates inputs, resolves `end_time_s` (null → `MAX(audio_clips.end_time) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`).
2. Computes `mix_graph_hash` via `compute_mix_graph_hash(project_dir)`.
3. Queries mix-cache by `(hash, start, end, sr, analyzer_version)`; returns `cached: true` on hit (skip 4–11).
4. Checks `pool/mixes/<hash>.wav`. If present, jump to 10.
5. Creates `asyncio.Event`, registers under fresh `request_id` in `_MIX_RENDER_EVENTS`.
6. Sends `mix_render_request` over WS. On send-exception → pop event, return error.
7. `await asyncio.wait_for(event.wait(), MIX_RENDER_TIMEOUT_S)`. Timeout → pop event, return timeout error.
8. Frontend handler pauses mixer (if playing), runs `renderMixToBuffer`, encodes 16-bit WAV, POSTs to `/mix-render-upload` with the `request_id` echoed.
9. Server validates form + WAV header + duration (≤100ms drift), writes `pool/mixes/<hash>.wav`, calls `set_mix_render_event(request_id)` which sets the Event. Pops from map in `finally`.
10. Re-stat disk; if still missing → error. Otherwise load WAV via `soundfile`, check `sr == sample_rate`.
11. Insert pending `mix_runs` row, run each requested analysis; wrap in try/except — on exception delete the row and return error.
12. Persist datapoints (rms, spectral_centroid), sections (clipping_event), scalars (peak_db, true_peak_db, lufs_integrated, dynamic_range_db, clip_count), update `rendered_path`.
13. Return `{run_id, cached:false, mix_graph_hash, start/end, rendered_path, scalars, clipping_events, analyses_written}`.

### Bounce round-trip

Mirrors the analyze flow with three differences:
- Cache key is `composite_hash` (encodes mode + selection + window + format).
- Frontend filters tracks via `filterTracksForBounce` before rendering; WAV encoded at requested `bit_depth`.
- On any early failure (WS send, timeout, stat/wave-open error, still-missing after event) the pending `audio_bounces` row is deleted before returning the error; post-success, row is updated with duration + size.

### Frontend handler error discipline

- All errors inside `handleMixRenderRequest` / `handleBounceAudioRequest` are caught + logged; handler returns normally.
- `finally` block always resumes live playback iff `wasPlaying && mixer`.
- No retry. Backend timeout is the single failure boundary.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `renderMixToBuffer` output is byte-for-byte equal to live mixer output over the same window for the same graph + seed (parity test already exists in `mix-live-vs-offline-fidelity.test.ts`).
- [ ] `encodePCMToWav` round-trips through `wave` (16/24) and `soundfile` (all three).
- [ ] `/mix-render-upload` rejects malformed hash / duration drift / channel mismatch / sample-rate mismatch and deletes any partially-written file.
- [ ] `/bounce-upload` has the same rejection semantics plus `bit_depth` passthrough.
- [ ] Cache hits short-circuit before opening the WAV.
- [ ] Timeouts do not create / leave cache rows in either table.
- [ ] No Python code paths synthesize or mix PCM.

## Tests

### Base Cases

The core behavior contract: the happy paths through each of the two tools, the primary validation failures, and the frontend-as-source-of-truth invariant.

#### Test: render-matches-live-bit-identical (covers R1, R2, R3)

**Given**:
- A mix graph with 2 tracks, 3 clips, one crossfade, master effects present
- Live mixer rendered the window [10.0, 20.0) at 48k/stereo into a reference buffer

**When**: `renderMixToBuffer(tracks, {startTimeS: 10, endTimeS: 20, sampleRate: 48000, channels: 2, masterEffects})`

**Then**:
- **pcm-length**: `pcm.length === ceil(10 * 48000) * 2`
- **bit-identical**: interleaved samples match live reference within 0 ulp (or documented tolerance `≤ 2^-23`)
- **channels-reported**: `result.channels === 2`
- **sr-reported**: `result.sampleRate === 48000`

#### Test: rejects-inverted-window (covers R2)

**Given**: any track list
**When**: `renderMixToBuffer([], {startTimeS: 5, endTimeS: 5, ...})`
**Then**:
- **throws**: synchronous throw before any OfflineAudioContext is constructed
- **factory-not-called**: `offlineCtxFactory` mock is not invoked

#### Test: rejects-unsupported-channel-count (covers R3)

**Given**: valid window
**When**: `renderMixToBuffer(tracks, {channels: 3, ...})`
**Then**:
- **throws**: `Error` mentioning `"channels must be 1 or 2"`

#### Test: rejects-unsupported-bit-depth (covers R4)

**Given**: arbitrary PCM
**When**: `encodePCMToWav(pcm, 48000, 2, 8 as WavBitDepth)`
**Then**:
- **throws**: `Error` mentioning `"bitDepth must be 16, 24, or 32"`

#### Test: encodes-16bit-pcm (covers R4)

**Given**: `pcm = [0, 0.5, -0.5, 1.0, -1.0]` interleaved mono
**When**: `encodePCMToWav(pcm, 48000, 1, 16)`
**Then**:
- **format-tag**: byte offset 20–21 = `0x0001` LE
- **bits-per-sample**: offset 34–35 = `16`
- **symmetric-full-scale**: peak sample encodes to `32767` / `-32767`
- **round-trips**: Python `wave.open(...)` reads back the same frame count

#### Test: encodes-24bit-pcm (covers R4)

**Given**: same PCM
**When**: `encodePCMToWav(pcm, 48000, 1, 24)`
**Then**:
- **format-tag**: `0x0001`
- **bits-per-sample**: `24`
- **bytes-per-sample**: block align byte offset 32–33 = `3`
- **le-packed**: sample bytes ordered low → high
- **round-trips**: `soundfile.read(...)` returns equal frame count

#### Test: encodes-32bit-float-lossless (covers R4)

**Given**: `pcm = [1.5, -1.5, 0.25]` (deliberately out of ±1 range)
**When**: `encodePCMToWav(pcm, 48000, 1, 32)`
**Then**:
- **format-tag**: `0x0003`
- **no-clipping**: decoded float samples equal `1.5, -1.5, 0.25` exactly (no clamp, no quantize)

#### Test: pauses-and-resumes-live-playback (covers R6)

**Given**: `mixer = { pause: spy, play: spy }`, `isPlaying = true`
**When**: `handleMixRenderRequest(msg, {mixer, isPlaying: true, ...mocked render+encode+fetch})`
**Then**:
- **pause-called-once**: `pause` invoked exactly once, before any render call
- **play-called-once**: `play` invoked exactly once, after upload resolves
- **pause-before-play**: pause call index < play call index

#### Test: no-pause-when-not-playing (covers R6)

**Given**: `mixer` present, `isPlaying = false`
**When**: `handleMixRenderRequest(...)`
**Then**:
- **pause-not-called**: `pause` never called
- **play-not-called**: `play` never called

## Non-Goals

- **Dithering on 24→16 downsample.** Current code uses plain round-to-nearest; a dithered path is noted as a TODO in `mix-render.ts`. Not part of this spec.
- **Multi-channel (>2) render.** Surround is not supported by either the WAV encoder or the channels validator.
- **Resumable uploads.** Upload is one-shot; network failures restart the round-trip from the next tool call.
- **Live streaming of bounce progress.** Bounce is whole-file on completion; no streamed chunks.
- **Independent cross-project cache sharing.** Each project has its own cache tables; `pool/` is per-project.
- **Mix-graph composition** — covered in `local.webaudio-mixer-and-mix-graph` (future).

---

## Open Questions

- **OQ-1 — Concurrent analyze_master_bus calls for the same mix_graph_hash.**
  Two in-flight analyses with identical cache keys would both miss, both register events, both request renders; the second upload would arrive to find the WAV already present. Behavior is not specified: does the second call re-run librosa and race on the cache row UNIQUE constraint? (Table row 39.)

- **OQ-2 — Concurrent bounces with identical composite_hash.**
  `audio_bounces` has a UNIQUE constraint on `composite_hash`. Second concurrent `create_bounce` would raise. Not handled in `_exec_bounce_audio`. (Table row 40.)

- **OQ-3 — Project mutation between hash compute and cache lookup.**
  `compute_mix_graph_hash` reads the DB, then cache lookup runs; no transaction bounds the two. A write between them (e.g. live edit) leaves open what "cache hit" means. (Table row 41.)

- **OQ-4 — WS message during ChatPanel unmount.**
  `handleMixRenderRequest` / `handleBounceAudioRequest` are fire-and-forget async. If ChatPanel unmounts mid-handler, the mixer pause/resume may happen against a stale `mixer` ref or a new one. (Table row 42.)

- **OQ-5 — Interrupted PCM upload.**
  Server reads `content_length` and expects the full body. A truncated request leaves `audio_data` short; the WAV parse step would reject it and the file would be deleted. But whether the server-side `rfile.read(content_length)` blocks forever on a dropped connection vs. returns short is implementation-dependent. (Table row 43.)

- **OQ-6 — User plays during offline render.**
  `wasPlaying` is snapshotted at entry. If the user clicks Play mid-render, the handler will still call `pause()` on completion (no-op if stopped) but may also not resume correctly if playback is expected to persist across the render. (Table row 44.)

- **OQ-7 — Upload after timeout.**
  If the upload arrives after `_MIX_RENDER_EVENTS[request_id]` has been popped, the event set is a no-op and the WAV becomes an orphan on disk (though content-addressed, so harmless unless the cache key is never re-requested). No GC of orphan WAVs is specified. (Table row 45.)
