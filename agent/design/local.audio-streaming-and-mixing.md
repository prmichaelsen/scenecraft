# In-Editor Audio Streaming and Mixing

**Concept**: Real-time multi-track audio playback inside the Timeline via a WebAudio streaming mixer, mirroring the server-side mixdown.
**Created**: 2026-04-21
**Status**: Design Specification

---

## Overview

Scenecraft's server (Task 91, `audio/mixdown.py`) renders the full multi-track mix only at export time. While editing, the Timeline currently plays only the legacy single `audioFile` (beats track) via a plain `<audio>` element — users can't hear audio clips, volume curves, mute toggles, or equal-power crossfades until they export.

This document specifies an in-browser mixer that composes the same multi-track output the server renders, in real time, so editing becomes an audible loop. The design is shaped by the target use case: a 3-hour video with four audio tracks that span the full duration, and by WebAudio's actual behaviour at that scale.

---

## Problem Statement

Editing audio clips is currently blind:

- Dropping a clip, trimming it, adjusting its volume curve, toggling mute, or moving a clip across tracks has no audible feedback until a full render.
- The server mixdown exists but takes seconds-to-minutes to run; triggering it on each edit is not a viable authoring loop.
- The existing `AudioTrack` element plays one file — the beats track — and was never designed for the multi-track/multi-clip model introduced in M9.

We need an editor-side renderer that:

1. Mixes every enabled track's clips with clip volume curves, track volume curves, mute, and equal-power crossfade on same-track overlaps.
2. Tracks the playhead position, seeks instantly, and recomputes the schedule on edits without re-decoding audio.
3. Stays within browser memory limits for the worst-case project (3hr × 4 tracks, i.e. 12 hours of decoded stereo audio).
4. Produces output perceptually equivalent to the server mixdown so WYSIWYG editing holds.

---

## Solution

**Real-time WebAudio mixer, streaming via `HTMLAudioElement` + `MediaElementAudioSourceNode`.**

Rather than decoding every clip into an `AudioBuffer` up front — which is sample-accurate but blows the memory budget at our target project size — each clip gets its own `<audio>` element. The browser streams samples from disk on demand, buffering only a few seconds ahead. Each element is fed through a `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` into the WebAudio graph, where clip and track gain curves are applied via `GainNode` automation. The audio thread sums everything to the destination.

### Graph shape (per track)

```
       ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
       │ Clip A: <audio> → MediaElementSource  │
       │  → clipGainA (curve-automated) ───┐   │
       │                                   │   │
       │ Clip B: <audio> → MediaElementSource │  (track)
       │  → clipGainB (curve-automated) ───┼──>GainNode──>(master mix)
       │                                   │   │
       │ Clip C: <audio> → MediaElementSource │
       │  → clipGainC (curve-automated) ───┘   │
       └───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Master sum connects to `audioContext.destination`.

### Key design choices

1. **Streaming, not full decode.** At 48 kHz stereo float32, a 3-hour track decoded in memory is ~4.1 GB; four tracks ≈ 16 GB. The browser OOMs well before that. Streaming keeps memory bounded at a few tens of MB regardless of project length.
2. **WebAudio for gain, `<audio>` for samples.** `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` bridges the streaming element into the WebAudio graph so `GainNode.gain.setValueAtTime` / `linearRampToValueAtTime` still drive the dB curves at audio-thread precision.
3. **Clip scheduling is JS-driven, not sample-accurate.** Unlike `AudioBufferSourceNode.start(when)`, HTML media elements have no sample-accurate scheduler; we call `.play()` / `.pause()` + `.currentTime = …` as the playhead crosses each clip's boundary. This costs 10–30 ms of jitter at clip start (see Trade-offs).
4. **Curve evaluation reuses the same math as the server.** `scenecraft.audio.curves.evaluate_curve_db` in Python has a direct TypeScript twin that samples the curve at material points and schedules them as `AudioParam` automation events.
5. **Server mixdown remains canonical for export.** The in-editor mixer is an approximation (perceptually equivalent, not bit-identical). Export always goes through `render_project_audio` in the engine.

### What the mixer does NOT do (yet)

- **Sample-accurate stacking of short percussive hits** — fine for music beds, would need hybrid decode path for sound-design workflows (deferred).
- **Effects (EQ, compression, reverb)** — out of scope for M9; shape of the graph admits them later as per-clip or per-track insert chains.
- **Looped clips, pitched playback, time-stretch** — not in the schema today.

## Implementation

### Module layout

```
src/lib/audio-mixer.ts          ← the mixer module (new)
src/components/editor/
  Timeline.tsx                  ← replace legacy <AudioTrack> with useAudioMixer()
  EditorStateContext.tsx        ← (no changes; mixer is a leaf of Timeline)
```

### Public API

```typescript
export type AudioMixer = {
  /** Number of tracks currently scheduled. */
  trackCount: number
  /** Start playback from the current `currentTime`. Idempotent. */
  play(): void
  /** Pause. All playing clips stop; their currentTime is preserved. */
  pause(): void
  /** Jump the playhead. Cheap — re-evaluates which clips should be active. */
  seek(seconds: number): void
  /** A clip or track changed (curve, mute, start/end, source). Re-schedule that entity in place. */
  updateClip(clipId: string): void
  updateTrack(trackId: string): void
  /** The full track list changed (add/remove/reorder). Full rebuild. */
  rebuild(tracks: AudioTrack[]): void
  /** Tear down all audio elements + nodes. */
  dispose(): void
}

export function createAudioMixer(projectName: string, tracks: AudioTrack[]): AudioMixer
```

### Internal data

```typescript
type ClipNode = {
  clip: AudioClip
  audio: HTMLAudioElement          // src = scenecraftFileUrl(project, clip.source_path)
  source: MediaElementAudioSourceNode
  gain: GainNode                   // per-clip dB curve + clip.muted
  active: boolean                  // currently playing (playhead inside clip)
}

type TrackNode = {
  track: AudioTrack
  gain: GainNode                   // per-track dB curve + track.muted + !track.enabled
  clips: Map<string, ClipNode>
}
```

### Scheduling loop

On `play()`, the mixer starts a `requestAnimationFrame`-level poll (or uses the Timeline's existing `currentTime` subscription, which is already rAF-driven):

```typescript
function tick(now: number) {
  for (const t of trackNodes.values()) {
    for (const c of t.clips.values()) {
      const inside = now >= c.clip.start_time && now < c.clip.end_time
      if (inside && !c.active) {
        c.audio.currentTime = (now - c.clip.start_time) + c.clip.source_offset
        c.audio.play().catch(() => {})  // may reject if paused by policy; harmless
        scheduleClipCurve(c, now)
        c.active = true
      } else if (!inside && c.active) {
        c.audio.pause()
        c.active = false
      }
    }
    scheduleTrackCurve(t, now)
  }
}
```

### Curve automation

The same dB curves stored in `audio_clips.volume_curve` (normalised x) and `audio_tracks.volume_curve` (seconds x) feed into `GainNode` automation. We sample the curve at its breakpoints (plus a couple of extra points for long linear segments) and emit:

```typescript
function scheduleClipCurve(c: ClipNode, playheadAtPlayStart: number) {
  const g = c.gain.gain
  g.cancelScheduledValues(audioCtx.currentTime)
  for (const [xNorm, db] of c.clip.volume_curve) {
    const xSeconds = c.clip.start_time + xNorm * (c.clip.end_time - c.clip.start_time)
    if (xSeconds < playheadAtPlayStart) continue
    const when = audioCtx.currentTime + (xSeconds - playheadAtPlayStart)
    g.linearRampToValueAtTime(dbToLinear(db), when)
  }
  if (c.clip.muted) g.setValueAtTime(0, audioCtx.currentTime)
}
```

Track curves are the same but with absolute-seconds x — no normalisation needed.

### Equal-power crossfade on overlap

The server mixdown handles overlap by `cos`/`sin` gain pairs. Client-side, when two clips on the same track overlap over `[a, b]`, we schedule on their respective `clipGain` nodes:

```typescript
// Fade out incumbent over overlap
incumbent.gain.gain.linearRampToValueAtTime(0, audioCtx.currentTime + (b - now))
incumbent.gain.gain.setValueCurveAtTime(cosCurve, audioCtx.currentTime, b - a)
// Fade in newcomer over overlap
newcomer.gain.gain.setValueCurveAtTime(sinCurve, audioCtx.currentTime + (a - now), b - a)
```

`cosCurve`/`sinCurve` are precomputed `Float32Array` samples of `cos(t·π/2)` and `sin(t·π/2)`. These multiply on top of the volume curve.

### Timeline integration

`Timeline.tsx` currently mounts a single `<AudioTrack>` that wraps an `<audio>` for `data.audioFile`. Replace with a `useAudioMixer` hook:

```typescript
const mixer = useAudioMixer(data.projectName, localAudioTracks)

useEffect(() => { isPlaying ? mixer.play() : mixer.pause() }, [isPlaying])
useEffect(() => { mixer.seek(currentTime) }, [currentTime])
useEffect(() => { mixer.rebuild(localAudioTracks) }, [localAudioTracks])
```

The legacy `AudioTrack` stays behind a settings toggle for one release (beats-only preview), then is removed.

## Benefits

- **Live editing loop**: curve drags, mute toggles, cross-track moves are audible within the same frame. Task 90's curve editor suddenly becomes useful.
- **Memory bounded**: ~10-50 MB regardless of project length; suitable for 3hr × 4 track workflows and well beyond.
- **No new server round-trips per edit**: all mixing happens client-side on the audio thread.
- **Shared curve semantics**: client and server evaluate the same dB-curve contract, so perceived export matches perceived preview.
- **Incremental complexity**: graph topology (per-clip gain → per-track gain → destination) is the minimum needed today and admits effect inserts, sends, etc. later without redesign.

---

## Trade-offs

- **Clip-start jitter (~10-30 ms)**: `HTMLAudioElement.play()` is not sample-accurate. One-time offset at the moment a clip enters, **not** continuous drift or stutter. Inaudible for music beds and the 3hr × 4 track primary use case. If short-clip stacking is ever needed, add a hybrid path (see Future Considerations).
- **Not bit-identical to export**: curve sampling density and WebAudio's internal resampling differ from the server's `np.interp` + ffmpeg chain. Perceptual equivalence is the contract, not sample-identity.
- **Simultaneous element limits**: browsers cap concurrent `<audio>` elements (Chrome ~75, Firefox ~100, Safari lower on iOS). Primary use case is well under; very-many-small-clip projects would need a pool-and-recycle layer (deferred).
- **First-play gesture requirement**: `AudioContext` requires a user gesture to start on most browsers. Timeline already has play buttons that satisfy this; need to be sure the mixer is lazy-initialized on first play, not on mount.
- **Disk/network I/O**: streaming implies the browser seeks into each file on demand. Local-file URLs served by the scenecraft API support `Range` requests already (MP4/M4A), but worth verifying for WAV.

---

## Dependencies

- WebAudio API (universal in modern browsers).
- `HTMLAudioElement` + `MediaElementAudioSourceNode`.
- Existing `scenecraftFileUrl` helper for clip source paths.
- Existing `data.audioTracks` in `EditorData` (SSR-loaded, Task 87).
- No new npm packages.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit tests (pure TS, no browser)

- `dbToLinear` matches the Python reference: `-60 → 0.001`, `-6 → 0.501`, `0 → 1.0`, `+6 → 1.995`.
- Curve sampling: given `[[0, 0], [1, -6]]`, sample at x=0.5 should yield `-3 dB` (`≈ 0.707`).
- `scheduleClipCurve` emits the expected sequence of `linearRampToValueAtTime` calls for a given playhead position (mock `GainNode.gain`).

### Integration tests (jsdom + WebAudio mock)

- Two non-overlapping clips: mixer activates/deactivates each at the right playhead position.
- Muted clip: clipGain value stays at 0 regardless of curve.
- Seek past a clip: `pause()` called on any previously-active elements.
- Curve edit triggers `updateClip`: new schedule replaces the old, cancelScheduledValues was called first.

### Manual/perceptual

- Drag a curve point during playback — amplitude change audible within one frame.
- Toggle track mute — silence within one frame.
- Seek backwards — playback resumes correctly from the new position, no clips stuck playing from the old position.
- Compare export WAV against in-editor playback by ear for a 30 s passage.

## Migration Path

1. Ship `audio-mixer.ts` + unit tests (no UI change).
2. Add a feature flag (`localStorage.scenecraft_use_audio_mixer = '1'`) in Timeline that chooses between the legacy `<AudioTrack>` and the new mixer. Default off.
3. Dogfood with the 3hr × 4 track project; fix any issues surfaced.
4. Flip the flag default to on; keep legacy available for one release.
5. Remove `AudioTrack` + `data.audioFile` path once multi-track mixer is the default.

## Key Design Decisions

### Playback architecture

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Mixing location | Client (browser WebAudio) | Server mixdown takes seconds-minutes; unsuitable for per-edit audible feedback. |
| Audio source | `HTMLAudioElement` + `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` | `decodeAudioData` path needs ~16 GB for 3hr × 4 tracks — browsers OOM. Streaming keeps memory bounded. |
| Gain stage | Per-clip `GainNode` → per-track `GainNode` → destination | Matches server mixdown topology; admits future effect inserts. |
| Curve automation | `linearRampToValueAtTime` from curve breakpoints | Same semantics as server's `np.interp`; AudioParam automation runs in the audio thread. |
| Source of truth for export | Server `render_project_audio` | Deterministic, reproducible, shareable. Client mixer is a live preview, not an export format. |

### Timing precision

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Clip start timing | `audio.play()` + `audio.currentTime = …` at playhead-crossing | Sample-accurate scheduling only possible with full decode, which is infeasible at target scale. |
| Acceptable jitter | 10-30 ms at clip start, no continuous drift | Inaudible for music beds (primary use case). Lip-sync / beat-stacked hits would need a hybrid path. |
| Seek semantics | Full re-evaluation of "active clips" on every seek | Cheap (tens of clips); avoids stale scheduled automation. |

### Scope boundaries

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Sample-accurate short clips | Deferred to a hybrid path (decode clips under a size threshold) | Not needed for M9's primary workflow; added complexity without user-visible payoff. |
| Effects (EQ, reverb, compression) | Out of scope | Graph topology supports per-clip/per-track inserts later; no schema or UI today. |
| Multi-output / headphone mix | Out of scope | Destination = single `AudioContext.destination`. |

## Future Considerations

- **Hybrid decode path**: for clips under ~10 s, decode into an `AudioBuffer` and schedule with `AudioBufferSourceNode.start(when)` for sample-accurate timing. Keeps the streaming path for long clips. Useful when lip-sync or percussive stacking becomes a workflow.
- **Effect insert chain**: between `clipGain` and `trackGain` (per-clip) or between `trackGain` and master (per-track). Requires new schema tables; see potential M12 plugin work.
- **AudioWorklet for custom DSP**: if we ever need non-WebAudio-native processing (e.g. loudness-normalisation, true-peak limiting in preview), AudioWorklet is the path.
- **Peak meters / headroom display**: tap the master and per-track `GainNode` outputs with `AnalyserNode` for VU-style meters in the Audio section header.
- **Loudness normalisation preview**: LUFS metering is a natural follow-up once meters land.
- **Server-preview parity harness**: a scripted A/B that renders the same 10 s passage through the client mixer and server mixdown, and FFT-compares — guards against drift in curve math.

**Status**: Design Specification
**Recommendation**: Implement as a new milestone (M12: In-Editor Audio Playback), starting with the `audio-mixer.ts` module + unit tests, then Timeline wire-up behind a feature flag.
